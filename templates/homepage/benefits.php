                        <h2><strong>BOOSTER</strong></h2>
                        <p>A cell phone signal booster, also known as cellular repeaters and amplifiers, increases your weak signal up to 32 times, whether at home, in your car, or in a public place such as an office building.</p>

                        <h2><strong>HOW?</strong></h2>
                        <p>It works by pulling in weak signal, amplifying it multiple times, then rebroadcasts the boosted signal to an area in need.</p>
